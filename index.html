        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Sadaqah Jariyah Welfare Center is established with the sincere intention of serving humanity
            for the pleasure of Allah (SWT). We believe that true charity is not limited to one-time help,
            but is a continuous effort that benefits people for years to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our welfare center focuses on long-term, sustainable solutions such as education, healthcare,
            food security, clean living conditions, and community development. Every project we undertake
            is planned carefully so that the reward continues even after the donor and volunteer have
            passed away — this is the essence of <strong>Sadaqah Jariyah</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the help of kind-hearted donors, volunteers, and supporters, we aim to build a society
            where no one is left hungry, uneducated, or without basic medical care.
